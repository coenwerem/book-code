function setup_code_ch3(compileFlag)
% For Windows user: you can run setup_code_ch3(0) (or launch the script as is) to just
% test that the libraries are correctly working on your computer. If you get an error, 
% you can recompile the libraries on your computer by running setup_code_ch3(1).

% For MacOs and Linux, you'll need to recompile the libraries on your computer by running setup_code_ch3(1).

%                                  WARNING FOR MAC USERS
% If you are using a Mac, there are some complements that you need to install 
% 
% First, you need to have Xcode install from app Store. Then, open it once
% and accept the license
% 
% Then, you have to open a terminal window at the folder matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws/mac_setup. 
% For that you have to open your finder, go to the folder matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws/mac_setup
% Then, right click and choose: "New terminal to folder"
% Here a terminal window will open. If you run pwd, you should see  ../matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws/mac_setup. 
% 
% We use SUDO command line, that means you‘ll have to enter you admin password. 
% 
% Then run the following command in this terminal:
% bash Mac_config.sh
%
% You will then need to run 'ch3_ex4_lpvDS.m' with 'est_options.type = 0' to finalize the setup.
